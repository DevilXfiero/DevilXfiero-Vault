## What is Node.js

A **runtime environment** for executing JavaScript code.

- Great for prototyping and agile development
- Superfast and highly scalable
- JavaScript everywhere
- Large ecosystem for open-source libs

## Node Architecture

Evert browser has JS Engine that converts JS Code to Machine code that computer can understand
Edge- Chakra
Mozilla Firefox - SpiderMonkey
Chrome - v8

Ryan Dahl
takes fastest JS engine v8 and embbeded it inside C++ program and called that program Node.exe

Node is not a programming language or framework it is runtime environment.


Highly Scalable due to Non-blocking Asynchronous nature of node.

Asynchronous

e.g waiter takes the order and give it to the kitchen now he  can take another order while chef prepares first order.

Waiter - thread allocated to handle a request

Synchronous
e.g waiter sitting in the kitchen while chef prepares meal and not do anything.


While database is busy executing query that thread can use to serve the request from another client when database prepares the result it puts the message in  **Event Queue**.
