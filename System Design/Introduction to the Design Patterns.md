## What are design patterns?

**Design patterns** are solutions to frequently occurring real-life problems in software design.

## Structure of design patterns

- **Pattern name:** This is an identification step that describes a design problem.
- **Intent:** This step describes the use case of the particular design pattern.
- **Motivation:** This step illustrates the problem and talks about the inner components in the pattern to solve the problem.
- **Structure:** This step visualizes the structure using a graphical representation of the classes in the pattern.
- **Consequences:** This step describes the trade-offs of a particular pattern.
- **Implementation:** This step illustrates an example of code in any popular programming language.


## Creational design patterns

These patterns are used to provide a mechanism for creating objects in a specific situation without revealing the creation method. The normal approach for creating an object might lead to complexities in the design of a project. These patterns allow flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a specific use case by providing control over the creation process.

## Structural design patterns
These patterns are concerned with class/object composition and relationships between objects. They let us add new functionalities to objects so that restructuring some parts of the system does not affect the rest. Hence, when some parts of the structure change, the entire system does not need to change.

## Behavioural design patterns

These patterns are concerned with communication between dissimilar objects in a system. They streamline communication and ensure that the information is synchronized between such objects.

## Architectural design patterns

These patterns are used for solving architectural problems within a given context in software architecture



## Introduction to creational design patterns

In this lesson, we will discuss creational design patterns. **Creational design patterns** deal with object creation mechanisms. As the name implies, these patterns provide optimized object creation techniques. They help cater to the design and complexity problems that might occur when using the basic approach. They also help control the creation of objects.
