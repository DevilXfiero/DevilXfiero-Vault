Docker allows us to deploy our applications inside "containers", which are kind of like _very_ lightweight virtual machines. Instead of just shipping an application, we can ship an application _and the environment it runs in_.

## Container

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.


We've had virtual machines (like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)) for a _long_ time. The trouble with virtual machines is that _they're slow as h`*`ck_. Booting one up usually takes _longer_ than a physical machine.

Containers, on the other hand, gives us 90% of the benefits of virtual machines, but are _super_ lightweight. _Containers boot up in seconds, while virtual machines can take minutes._

## Why Are Containers Lightweight?

Virtual machines virtualize _hardware_, they emulate what a physical computer does at a low level. Containers virtualize at the _operating system_ level. Isolation between containers that are running on the same machine is still _really good_. For the most part, each container _feels like_ it has its own operating system and filesystem. In reality, a lot of resources are being shared, but they're being shared securely through [namespaces](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/).

# Images

So a "container" is kinda like a lightweight VM, great... so what's an _image_?

- **Image**: A read-only _definition_ of a container
- **Container**: an _instance_ of a virtualized read-write environment

A container is basically an image that's **actively running**. In other words, you boot up a container _from_ an image. You can create multiple separate containers all from the same image (it's _kinda_ like the relationship between classes and objects).

docker pull docker/getting-started
docker images

# Run a Container

Now that you've downloaded the [getting started image](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/getting-started), let's _run_ it inside a new container. The `docker run` command starts a new container from an image. Let's break down the syntax:


```bash
# this is just an example, don't run this
docker run -d -p hostport:containerport namespace/name:tag
```

- `-d`: Run in detached mode (doesn't block your terminal)
- `-p`: Publish a container's port to the host (forwarding)
- `hostport`: The port on your local machine
- `containerport`: The port inside the container
- `namespace/name`: The name of the image (usually in the format `username/repo`)
- `tag`: The version of the image (often `latest`)

1. Use the `run` command to start a new container from the "getting started" image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8965:80 docker/getting-started:latest
```

2.  You should see the container running in the "Containers" tab of Docker Desktop. Run this on the command line to see the running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

On one of the columns you should see this:

```
PORTS
0.0.0.0:8965->80/tcp
```

This is saying that port `8965` on your local "host" machine is being forwarded to port `80` on the running container. Port `80` is conventionally used for HTTP web traffic. Navigate to `http://localhost:8965` and you should see a webpage served from the container!


# Stop a Container

Okay, now you know how to start a new instance of a container from an image... but how do you _stop_ it? There are two primary ways:

- `docker stop`: This stops the container by issuing a `SIGTERM` signal to the container. You'll typically want to use `docker stop`.
- `docker kill`: This stops the container by issuing a `SIGKILL` signal to the container. This is a more forceful way to stop a container, and should be used as a last resort.

1. run `docker ps` again, and copy the container ID.
2. Run `docker stop CONTAINER_ID` where `CONTAINER_ID` is the ID of your container


docker stop $(docker ps -q) // to stop all running docker containers
