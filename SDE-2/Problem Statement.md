**Preplat** – Personal Preparation Platform

### 📌 Problem Statement

Preparing for SDE interviews requires managing multiple parallel efforts—DSA practice, system design learning, project building, and job applications. These activities are often tracked across disconnected tools, leading to poor visibility, low motivation, and inconsistent progress.

Preplat is a personal preparation platform that provides a **single source of truth** for tracking daily preparation activities, measuring progress, and reinforcing consistency through rewards and reminders.
